    <h1>About Wheels n' Deals</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to Wheels n' Deals, we serve our local community of skateboarders of all skill levels and experience.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2021, Wheels n' Deals has been a staple for the local skaters to build their own boards, make repairs, as well as purchase pre-built skateboards of varying types.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy our skateboards as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Wheels n' Deals Team</p>
