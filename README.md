# MVC Web App Skate Shop Website

This project involved creating a customizable web application using Spring Boot with a Java backend and a Thymeleaf-based front-end. The task was to build a shop with five products and five generic parts, demonstrating the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The project leveraged Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration, embedded web server, and database integration for a streamlined development experience.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
* **Spring Boot:** Simplifies the development of RESTful web applications.
* **Thymeleaf:** Template engine for dynamic HTML generation.
* **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation.
* **H2 Database:** Lightweight, in-memory database for testing.
* **GitLab:** Version control and repository management.
* **IntelliJ IDEA:** Development environment for Java.

### Outcomes:
This project demonstrated the application of the MVC architecture in a real-world scenario, focusing on modularity, maintainability, and efficient data handling. The integration of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf provided a seamless development experience, while the use of Docker prepared the application for scalable deployment. The user can now access and purchase skatboard parts and fully-built skateboards. The inventory updates based on purchases made.
